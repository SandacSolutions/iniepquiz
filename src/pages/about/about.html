  <h1>Welcome to INIEP Quiz!</h1>
  <small><p>By Lucas Bazante and Giovanna Rodrigues</p></small>
  <br />
  <p>
    This quiz is designed to accelerate your bilingual learning and build a
    robust vocabulary.
  </p>
  <p>
    Made by students of INIEP Languages Courses, it is designed mainly for
    advanced English learners, due to its difficulty in certain quizzes, like
    the Synonyms Quiz. This difficulty comes from the high level of vocabulary
    required, something that begginers won't have in shape.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, for you, beginner, we recommend that you start by quizzes that won't
    require of you a high level understanding in the language. It doesn't mean
    that it will be all easy, but at least the difficulty won't come from the
    grammar, but from the questions themselfs. In time, you'll be familiar with
    the model of this game, and you'll be able to try the grammar based quizzes,
    and even if you get just a few correct, your vocabulary will be increased
    before you know it.
  </p>
  <p>
    And for you that are in advanced stages of your course or are just a good
    speaker/reader, do as you please and start with any quiz you want, but give
    more attention to the grammar base ones, because they'll test your English
    and increase your vocabulary, that's the primary objective of this quiz.
  </p>
  <p>
    But more important of everything, try to have as fun as you can! The INIEP
    Courses enjoys your participation! And anything you have in mind, whether
    critical or suggestion, just let us know! Give us your feedback!
