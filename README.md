# A simple quiz made using Ionic 3 Framework.


A didatic english quiz with grammar and general questions. Made by Lucas Bazante and Giovanna Rodrigues for INIEP Language Courses.

The objective of this quiz is to make it easier to the students that are learning English to assimilate better the grammar topics and general phrases said in English. We think that playing games like quizzes helps the learner to get better in thinking in the language that they're learning, and thinking well in the language also makes they speak better and write better, as the thinking comes first of the actions. Besides, learning something like a new language with something that you like (as one of the categories of the quiz) and something ludic is an efficient way to improve your learning. So, please have fun and try to get as much knowledge as you can!!!

It includes the following categories (until now):
* Synonyms
* Phrasal Verbs
* History
* General Questions

We hope we can add more categories for better user experience and learning.
